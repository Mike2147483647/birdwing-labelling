load data separately
create dataset for training
create functions for extracting seqID and its corr subset easier

notes:

use cross entropy rather than just softmax since softmax gradients are flatter for larger values
bcewithlogitloss is treating each entry of y (hot encoded) as a binary (0-1) classification, and uses crossentropy for each binclass
for a datapoint, hot encoded y is 32 (padded) x 9 (num_class) where each row is 01s,
    with 1 at idx indicating this coord has class idx
because of how we trained and test the model (see trainandtest.test_loop), output with model trained with BCEwithLogitLoss
    its entries is 1 if its >0.5 after sigmoid

use 'here', pathlib for navigating the data files across subdirectories
try branching if want to use sus actions from AIs
poetry for python env, uv for cool people
__init__ for package management, wont need to load anything in those packages

try not to have py in data
data process, training,

look in data leaking. very sus about high acc
randomize frames and
filter by bird

vertical to the floor
horizontal neg to the perch
ref frame at the of the flight

8 markers cleared, sus, check data leakage and units of the tensor outputs
    method of calculating accuracy may not be reliable
    currently we count the number of correctly matching 01 in each entry of y and pred
    thats 81 for every data, likely to be correct
    things may change if counting each frame
subsetting and make the problem harder for the machines
checking what is hard the machine eg perchDist, type of flight
then missing markers and extra markers
missing:
    remove some markers
extra: add some noise markers
can also visualize the data markers


11/8 around 3w in us


first randomize the order then pad to 32 rows for each matrix (data point)
if want to train for missing labels (# markers <8), randomly set row and resp label to 0,
move to bottom and then usual training set creation procedure

must rename to 'markers_matrix' for data matrices
'label' for labels
maybe move createtraining to the actual training files, not under data
